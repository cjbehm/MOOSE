--- @type AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER
-- @extends Core.Fsm#FSM


--- A dynamic cargo handling capability for AI groups.
-- 
-- Carrier equipment can be mobilized to intelligently transport infantry and other cargo within the simulation.
-- The AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER module uses the @{Cargo.Cargo} capabilities within the MOOSE framework, to enable Carrier GROUP objects 
-- to transport @{Cargo.Cargo} towards several deploy zones.
-- @{Cargo.Cargo} must be declared within the mission to make the AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER object recognize the cargo.
-- Please consult the @{Cargo.Cargo} module for more information. 
-- 
-- # 1) AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER constructor
--   
--   * @{#AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER.New}(): Creates a new AI\_CARGO\_DISPATCHER object.
-- 
-- # 2) AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER is a FSM
-- 
-- This section must be read as follows. Each of the rows indicate a state transition, triggered through an event, and with an ending state of the event was executed.
-- The first column is the **From** state, the second column the **Event**, and the third column the **To** state.
-- 
-- So, each of the rows have the following structure.
-- 
--  * **From** => **Event** => **To**
-- 
-- Important to know is that an event can only be executed if the **current state** is the **From** state.
-- This, when an **Event** that is being triggered has a **From** state that is equal to the **Current** state of the state machine, the event will be executed,
-- and the resulting state will be the **To** state.
-- 
-- These are the different possible state transitions of this state machine implementation: 
-- 
--  * Idle => Start => Monitoring
--  * Monitoring => Monitor => Monitoring
--  * Monitoring => Stop => Idle
--      
--  * Monitoring => Pickup => Monitoring
--  * Monitoring => Load => Monitoring
--  * Monitoring => Loading => Monitoring
--  * Monitoring => Loaded => Monitoring
--  * Monitoring => PickedUp => Monitoring
--  * Monitoring => Deploy => Monitoring
--  * Monitoring => Unload => Monitoring
--  * Monitoring => Unloaded => Monitoring
--  * Monitoring => Deployed => Monitoring
--  * Monitoring => Home => Monitoring
-- 
--      
-- ## 2.1) AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER States
-- 
--   * **Monitoring**: The process is dispatching.
--   * **Idle**: The process is idle.
-- 
-- ## 2.2) AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER Events
-- 
--   * **Start**: Start the transport process.
--   * **Stop**: Stop the transport process.
--   * **Monitor**: Monitor and take action.
--   
--   * **Pickup**: Pickup cargo.
--   * **Load**: Load the cargo.
--   * **Loading**: The dispatcher is coordinating the loading of a cargo.
--   * **Loaded**: Flag that the cargo is loaded.
--   * **PickedUp**: The dispatcher has loaded all requested cargo into the CarrierGroup.
--   * **Deploy**: Deploy cargo to a location.
--   * **Unload**: Unload the cargo.
--   * **Unloaded**: Flag that the cargo is unloaded.
--   * **Deployed**: All cargo is unloaded from the carriers in the group.
--   * **Home**: A Carrier is going home.
-- 
-- # 3) Enhance your mission scripts with **Tailored** Event Handling!
-- 
-- Use these methods to capture the events and tailor the events with your own code!
-- All classes derived from AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER can capture these events, and you can write your own code.
-- 
-- In order to properly capture the events, it is mandatory that you execute the following actions using your script:
-- 
--   * Copy / Paste the code section into your script.
--   * Change the CLASS literal to the object name you have in your script.
--   * Within the function, you can now write your own code!
--   * IntelliSense will recognize the type of the variables provided by the function. Note: the From, Event and To variables can be safely ignored, 
--     but you need to declare them as they are automatically provided by the event handling system of MOOSE.
-- 
-- You can send messages or fire off any other events within the code section. The sky is the limit!
